        The website is designed greatly and the execution of said website is impeccable. Everything within the website is organized and each item has a meaning and a reason for it to be there. The uniqueness of the website combined with the design principles being used make the site distinguished when compared to others. There is consistency within the layout, as in most pages it almost follows the exact same or similar layout. For example, most pages contain words with catchphrases such as “Never out of MANA” and then follows up with content based on the page which makes it extremely easy to follow. This also allows for an ease of navigation for the user as the website itself is straightforward and the links are always in the same area for each page. For this site specifically, the navigation bar is on the top right and easy to access, and ordered. It’s also made into a drop-down box to make the navigation bar more concise; improving the user interaction. The website is responsive regardless of the technology being used, which improves the accessibility. To add on, the user can only interact with the website but not anymore beyond that which prevents the user from being exposed to unnecessary error messages. Overall, the color scheming, font-style, and design all compliment each other making the website phenomenal and a great example of a good website.

      <h2>Bad Web App Design</h2>

        This is undeniably an ugly and poorly designed website. There is no consistency between pages, and even on the same page, there is no consistency in layout, font color and size. There is no grid, no real rhyme or reason. Each listing is just thrown on the page, no order to them. Different sizes, some have photos, some don’t, it’s just seemingly random and unorganized. Also, it’s not at all formatted to fit on desktop or mobile, it doesn’t matter what device you’re on, you’re going to have to scroll vertically and horizontally to see all of the information. It’s just a nightmare to look through. Each page has a different design, different headers, just no consistency anywhere. It’s hard to navigate the site, especially on mobile. All of the links are small and difficult to click, with some linking to pages that don’t seem to actually exist. Links are just scattered across the page, not in an ordered format. In terms of accessibility, text is not readable, there are no features I can see that are designed for visually impaired people or any other disabilities. Overall, it’s hardly designed for the average person to read, much less anyone that struggles. For errors, there are links to sites that either don’t exist, or just won’t display properly. In general, this site is a prime example of poor design.
