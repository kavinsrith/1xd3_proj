        <b>Initial Client Report</b>
        <br><br>
<b>1. The project name</b> <br>
Kp wrapz<br><br>

<b>2. The name and organizational affiliation of your client</b><br>
Parmeet Riar; friend of a member of the web dev group and co-owns custom car wrapping and detail business
<br><br>

<b>3. An initial report on what the client would like a web app or collection of web apps to be able to
do for them. Make sure the report contains the following information:
 Who are the target users of the app or apps? Are they more likely to be mobile or
desktop users? Do they have any other special characteristics or needs?</b> <br>
Target users are people in the GTA (or anywhere) that would like to customize and personalize their cars through custom car wrapping services as well as maintaining their vehicle through detailing services. Users can be mobile or desktop but full functionality of website encourages desktop usage.
<br><br>


<b>What basic, static information should be available through the app or apps? (For
example, company name, address, contact info, etc.)</b><br>
About page for founders and owners, contact information, company name, history and mission statement, have a functionality for potential hiring and training of future/ potential employees, reviews page for past jobs as well as before and after photos for those jobs, functionality to book and get quotes
<br><br>
<b>What are some important design elements of the look and feel of the web app? Is there anything that the client does not want to see in the design of their web app?<br></b>
Colors: blue black and white, drop down menus for sub sections of categories like services offered<br><br>

<b>What data does the client need to be managed and/or presented to the user? (For
example, information on users, products, user-generated content, schedules, statistics,
teams, leaderboards, user badges and trophies, etc.)</b><br>
The website manages customer data such as contact information, vehicle details, and service requests to support quote submissions and client communication. It stores and presents service and wrap option information, including descriptions, categories, and example images, allowing users to explore available offerings. The system maintains a gallery of completed projects and testimonials to showcase past work and build trust with potential customers. Inquiry and quote request data is tracked internally by the business to manage workflow and respond efficiently. Optional scheduling and availability information may be stored to help users select preferred service timelines. Optional but desired features on the server side (not available publicly) where owner of the company can log and keep track of past jobs and information about past jobs such as customer contact info, the work and services done for them, price and money information, and extra notes about the jobs done for them.
<br><br>
<b>Are there any simple interactive elements such as games, tools, or animations that
users of their web apps might enjoy or benefit from? (e.g., a mortgage calculator, a
graphing tool, a simple game, etc.)</b><br>

We have many ideas for interactive elements, only one we know for sure will be included is things like before and after comparison, custom wrap selection page, we would like to but are not confident yet to add features such as a 3d preview model where the user will be able to visualize their car in their chosen wrap color. Another possible feature is a slider option that shows the before and after of their car through a slider to see the progress made on their car
